유체 : 연속 deformation. 
Pressure : 모멘텀 로스
점성 : 모멘텀 교환
Liquid : 온도 증가에 따라서 점성 감소, 반면 가스는 증가 + Surfacce tension.
Surface tension :is attributed to unequal forces of attraction on the molecules constituting the interface between the liquid and its vapour or gas.

Scalr (density, pressure), vector (velocity), tensor (stress)

A fluid is distinguished from a solid in its response to the application of a shear stress.

유체는 고체와 구분된다. shear stress가 가해졌을 때의 반응에서

A fluid **deforms** continuously—leading to a continuous change of shape or size or both- **under** the action of a shear stress. While a solid also deforms upon the application of a shear stress, a fluid continues to deform as long as the shear stress exists.

in the case of solid, equlibiruim is established between the applied force and internal resistvice force. There is no further change in the deformation even though the force is still acting on it. in a fluid too, an internal resistive force is set up; however, as we will see, it is propotional to the rate of deformation . When equilibrium is established, then the rate of deformation remains constant; the fluid continues to deform resulting in fluid flow.

deformation 의 연속적인 발생을 통해서 fluid가 발생한다고 볼 수 있음.

Pressure : resulting loss of momentum by the colliding molecules. 
Viscosity : a measure of this momentum diffusivity.
Liquids : usally exhibit a more complicated behavior and thier viscosity decrease rapidly with increasing tempearture (in gas, increase of visocisty with temperature), An

Thus, a shear force, equivalent to the viscous force, has to be applied in order to maintain a given velocity gradient in a fluid.

When there is relative motion within the fluid, the movement of molecules across two adjacent layers having different velocities leads to a net trasport of momentum from the higher momentum layer to the lower momentum layer. This can bee construed as a dffiusion of momentum along the gradient such that a momentum flux exists from the layer with higher momentum to  the tone with olower Vis

### 영어 분석
Some complex fluids, such as polymeric solutions and concentrated sugar solutions, exhibit a more complicated behaviour wherein the response of the fluid to a shear stress consists of a combination of fluid-like and solid-like behaviour.

해석:
"고분자 용액이나 고농도의 설탕 용액과 같은 복합 유체는 전단 응력에 대한 반응이 유체 같은 행동과 고체 같은 행동이 결합된 형태로 나타나는 더 복잡한 행동을 보인다."
